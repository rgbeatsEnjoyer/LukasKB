# Luca Keyboard
A unique (as far as i'm aware) keyboard using an alice and HHKB inspired FRLTKL keyboard. The recomended version is the low profile version, but full height MX/ALPS version is avaliable, as well as an MX plate for a handwired build. Powered by the RP2040, this keyboard supports {insert firmware and vial if i set it up} for plenty of layers and user-customisable layouts.

# Features on both versions:
-An ergonomic, compact and practical design
-RP2040 microcontroler with {firmware} with a matrix with SOD123 diodes to allow full NKRO
-Full FR4 construction

# Features only on the low profile version:
-Low profile, comfortable Kahil Choc mechanical switches

-One board, decreasing cost and improving portability
