# Lukas Keyboard

~Important~
I haven't actually finished making the choc version, or even started on the MX/Alps version

A unique (as far as i'm aware) keyboard using an alice and HHKB inspired FRLTKL keyboard. The recomended version is the low profile version, but full height MX/ALPS version is avaliable, as well as an MX plate for a handwired build. Powered by the RP2040, this keyboard supports {insert firmware and vial if i set it up} for plenty of layers and user-customisable layouts.

# Features on both versions:
- An ergonomic, compact and practical design
- RP2040 microcontroler with {firmware} with a matrix with SOD123 diodes to allow full NKRO
- Full FR4 construction

# Features only on the low profile version:
- Low profile, comfortable Kahil Choc mechanical switches
- Choc Stabilisers
- One board, decreasing cost and improving portability
- thin and portable

# Ordering instructions:
- download all of the files in the 'production' folder
- go to jlcpcb.com (or your fab house of choice) and import the .gerber file in.
- order with pcb assembly- the default .bom file will include everything required excluding switches, keycaps, and stabilisers: you will have to choose and install these yourself.
- note:  be carefull with choosing keycaps with switches and stabilisers: chocV2 uses mx-lp keycaps, chocV1 uses choc keycaps.
