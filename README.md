# Luca Keyboard
A unique (as far as i'm aware) keyboard using an alice and HHKB inspired FRLTKL keyboard. The recomended version is the low profile version, but full height MX/ALPS version is avaliable, as well as an MX plate for a handwired build. Powered by the RP2040, this keyboard supports {insert firmware and vial if i set it up} for plenty of layers and user-customisable layouts. As of writing, there are no stabilisers avaliable for the low profile version (unless you're willing to harvest them from something else), but any plate mount or pcb mounted stabilisers can be used for the mx version.

# Features on both versions:
- An ergonomic, compact and practical design
- RP2040 microcontroler with {firmware} with a matrix with SOD123 diodes to allow full NKRO
- Full FR4 construction

# Features only on the low profile version:
- Low profile, comfortable Kahil Choc mechanical switches
- One board, decreasing cost and improving portability

# Ordering instructions:
- download all of the files in the 'production' folder
- go to jlcpcb.com (or your fab house of choice) and import the .gerber file in.
- order with pcb assembly- the default .bom file will include everything required excluding switches, keycaps, and stabilisers: you will have to choose and install these yourself.
- note:  be carefull with choosing keycaps with switches: chocV2 uses mx-lp keycaps, chocV1 uses choc keycaps.
